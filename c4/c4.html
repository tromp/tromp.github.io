John's Connect Four Playground</h1>
<HR>

The first person to (weakly)
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_board_games">
solve</a> the game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four">
Connect-4</a> was
<a href="http://fabpedigree.com/james/index.htm">
James D. Allen</a>, as announced in a rec.games.programmer posting on
Oct 1 1988. <P>
Only 15 days later,
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victor_Allis">Victor Allis</a>
announced his independently discovered solution, described in
<a href="http://www.connectfour.net/Files/connect4.pdf">his thesis</a>.
<P>
Inspired by these results, I set out to strongly solve the game by compiling a
database of all 8-ply positions with their theoretical result.
This took about 40,000 hours of computation on the Sun and SGI workstations at the CWI.
A subset of this database, namely the 67557 unfinished and unforced positions,
is available as a <A HREF="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Connect-4">dataset</A>
for machine learning experiments.
The value of all 1+7+49+343+2401=2801 up to 4-ply positions turned out
to make a nice
<a href="../thesis.html">illustration</A> for my own thesis cover.
With the help of this database, any position in the game can be evaluated
in a matter of seconds.
<P>
If you see no PLAY! button right below this line, then your browser has Java absent or disabled;
I suggest you try this <a href="http://nyc.cs.berkeley.edu:8080/gcweb/ui/game.jsp?game=connect4">Javascript based solver</a> instead, which also sports a more conventional interface.
<P>
<applet code=ConnectFourLaunch.class width=100 height=50>
<param name=file value=book.8>
<param name=label value="PLAY!">
</applet>
This applet plays a perfect game of connect-4 with the help
of the 8-ply database (read from a 12Kbyte compressed file).
The applet understands the keys b, f, m, 1-7 and q for
back, forward, move, play, and quit.
The right mouse button takes you back or forward to when a certain stone
was played.
<P>
Solving connect-4 positions also makes a decent benchmark aptly named 
<a href="fhour.html">Fhourstones </a> as a pun on
the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhrystone">Dhrystone</a> benchmark.
The included source is a useful guide to writing an exhaustive alpha-beta
search program with a transposition table and dynamic move ordering.
<P>
This somewhat improved
<A HREF="Connect4.java">board logic code</A> shows
how to best represent connect-4 bitboards, test for a win with 8 shifts/ands,
and encode a position in 49 bits. Dominikus Herzberg offers this
<a href="https://github.com/denkspuren/BitboardC4/blob/master/BitboardDesign.md">detailed explanation</a>
for the benefit of his students.

<P>
Based on that code and a smarter transposition table replacement strategy,
my solver is now busy compiling results on different board sizes:

+ is a first player win, = a tie, and - a second player win. <br>
New results and independent verification more than welcome!

The 9x6 result just finished in Nov 2005, requiring examination
of about 2E13 positions, which took some 2000 hours of computation
on a 1.4Ghz Opteron 840.

In late 2015 I finished solving 8x8 to a 2nd player win. The necessary code, accompanied by an opening book, is available at <a href=https://github.com/tromp/fhourstones88>github.com/tromp/fhourstones88</a>.

One curious observation is that in the 6xh games, the winning starting moves
are NEVER in the central columns.

<H2> Number of connect-4 positions</H2>

I've started a project to count the number of possible positions
in standard 7x6 connect-4. So far, I've obtained the following
results for smaller boards. Independent verification is more than welcome!

<table border>

<tr><th> 8</th> <td>9</td> <td>13343</td> <td>8424616</td> <td>1104642469</td> </tr>

Googling for the final result, 4531985219092, shows that it was
already determined back in 2008 by Stefan Edelkamp and Peter Kissmann in
their paper <a href="http://www.tzi.de/~edelkamp/publications/conf/ki/EdelkampK08-1.pdf">Symbolic Classification of General Two-Player Games</a>.
I didn't expect independent verification so quickly!
