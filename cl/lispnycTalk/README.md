# minslides

A single web page presentation slide tool that is just ridiculously small and simple.

* Keyboard slide navigation!
* Style with _real_ CSS!
* Mark up your content with HTML technology!
* Presentation also doubles as a web page!

Just add slides like so:

```
<div class="slide">
	<h1>Hello world!</h1>
    <p>This is <strong>minslides</strong>, the minimalistic HTML slide presentation "framework".
    <p>Press the <strong>J</strong> key on your keyboard to go the next slide.
</div>
```

The whole thing is in `minslides.html` which serves as a complete demo, documentation, and
the starting point for your own presentation. Enjoy!

To see how surprised I was at how easy it is to do something like this in the year 2023, check out
