I tried adding a Mimblewimble page once, and it got deleted for not being notable (ie. not appearing in the press). In case anyone wants to try again, here's the markdown:

    '''Mimblewimble''' is a [[blockchain]] protocol created to improve [[privacy]],
    [[fungibility]], and [[scalability]] of blockchains.

    The Mimblewimble protocol uses blinding factors of balancing inputs and outputs
    in a [[commitment scheme]] as private keys. Sender and receiver must interact
    to construct a joint signature to authorize a transfer of funds. Blocks in
    Mimblewimble have all their constituent transactions aggregated into one giant
    transaction, erasing the original transaction boundaries.  The initial block
    download further benefits from '''cut-through''', in which all spent outputs
    cancel against corresponding inputs, erasing most of the blockchain
    history.<ref>{{Cite
