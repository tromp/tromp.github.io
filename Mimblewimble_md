'''Mimblewimble''' is a [[blockchain]] protocol created to improve [[privacy]],
[[fungibility]], and [[scalability]] of blockchains.

The Mimblewimble protocol uses blinding factors of balancing inputs and outputs
in a [[commitment scheme]] as private keys. Sender and receiver must interact
to construct a joint signature to authorize a transfer of funds. Blocks in
Mimblewimble have all their constituent transactions aggregated into one giant
transaction, erasing the original transaction boundaries.  The initial block
download further benefits from '''cut-through''', in which all spent outputs
cancel against corresponding inputs, erasing most of the blockchain
history.<ref>{{Cite
